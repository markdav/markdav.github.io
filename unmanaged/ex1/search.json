The location and number of these shipping screws depend on how the server was shipped during product delivery. Remove these shipping screws before the first time installation of the server into the rack. This will allow the front drive cages to be extended out of the chassis.  Do one or both of the following steps to remove the shipping screws securing the front drive cages:  Remove the shipping screws on the sides of the chassis.  Remove the shipping screws on the rack ears:  If installed, remove the security bezel.  Remove the shipping screws on the rack ears.  Install server options  For options installation information, see the documentation that ships with the option. For server&#8209;specific information, see the  HPE Apollo 4200 Gen9 Server User Guide.  Install the server in the rack  Before installing the server, be sure that you understand the following warnings and cautions.     @@@  WARNING:  To reduce the risk of personal injury or damage to the equipment, be sure that:  The leveling jacks are extended to the floor.  The full weight of the rack rests on the leveling jacks.  The stabilizing feet are attached to the rack if it is a single-rack installation.   The racks are coupled together in multiple-rack installations.   Only one component is extended at a time. A rack may become unstable if more than one component is extended for any reason.        @@@  WARNING:  To reduce the risk of personal injury or equipment damage when unloading a rack:  At least two people are needed to safely unload the rack from the pallet. An empty 42U rack can weigh as much as 115 kg (253 lb), can stand more than 2.1 m (7 ft) tall, and might become unstable when being moved on its casters.  Never stand in front of the rack when it is rolling down the ramp from the pallet. Always handle the rack from both sides.        @@@  WARNING:  To reduce the risk of personal injury or damage to the equipment, adequately stabilize the rack before extending a component outside the rack. Extend only one component at a time. A rack may become unstable if more than one component is extended.        @@@  WARNING:  When installing a server in a telco rack, be sure that the rack frame is adequately secured at the top and bottom to the building structure.        @@@  WARNING:  This server is very heavy. To reduce the risk of personal injury or damage to the equipment:  Observe local occupational health and safety requirements and guidelines for manual handling.  Reduce the weight of the server by removing the drives and power input modules before installing or removing the server from the rack.  Obtain adequate assistance to lift and stabilize the server during installation or removal. Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends that a minimum of two people are required for installing or removing the server from the rack. A third person might be required to help align the server if the server is installed higher than chest level.  Use caution when installing or removing the server from the rack; it is unstable when not fastened to the rails.     @@@  WARNING:  To reduce the risk of electric shock or damage to the equipment:  Do not disable the power cord grounding plug. The grounding plug is an important safety feature.  Plug the power cord into a grounded (earthed) electrical outlet that is easily accessible at all times.  Unplug the power cord from the power supply to disconnect power to the equipment.  Do not route the power cord where it can be walked on or pinched by items placed against it. Pay particular attention to the plug, electrical outlet, and the point where the cord extends from the server.        @@@  CAUTION:  Always plan the rack installation so that the heaviest item is on the bottom of the rack. Install the heaviest item first, and continue to populate the rack from the bottom to the top.        @@@  CAUTION:  Protect the server from power fluctuations and temporary interruptions with a regulating uninterruptible power supply. This device protects the hardware from damage caused by power surges and voltage spikes and keeps the system in operation during a power failure.        @@@  CAUTION:  Do not operate the server for long periods with the front drive cages extended. When the front drive cages are extended while the server is powered on, do one of the following:  If the iLO 08-HD Max sensor reading is reporting a temperature value, monitor the status of the front drive health/thermal LED. When this LED starts flashing amber, immediately slide the drive cages back into the chassis and keep them there until the LED turns green.  If the iLO 08-HD Max sensor reading is reporting an N/A value, monitor how long the drive cages have been out of the chassis. Before reaching the 140 sec mark, slide the drive cages back into the chassis and keep them there for at least 300 sec before extending them out again.  Failure to observe this caution will result in improper airflow and insufficient cooling that can lead to thermal damage.  To install the server in the rack:  Install the server rack rail in the rack. See the documentation that ships with the HPE 2U Shelf-Mount Adjustable Rail Kit.  The chassis retention brackets help to stabilize the server when the front drive cages are extended.  The illustration below shows the rack rail with the shelf portion highlighted in gray.  Install the chassis retention brackets on the non-shelf portion of the rack rail.  Install the server into the rack.  Tighten the rack ear thumbscrews.  Make sure the pins on the chassis retention brackets slot into the notches located on both sides of the chassis.  Install drives and power input modules  For options installation information, see the documentation that ships with the option. For server&#8209;specific information, see the HPE Apollo 4200 Gen9 Server User Guide.  Connect cabling and power cords  Connect the iLO management cabling.  The dedicated iLO connector shown in the image is an optional component. If you do not have this option installed, the iLO management connection will be routed through the NIC 1/shared iLO connector.  Connect the network cabling.  Connect the power cord to the power input module.  AC power input module  DC power input module  For more information about cabling the system, see the HPE Apollo 4200 Gen9 Server User Guide.  Power up and select boot options  On servers operating in UEFI Boot Mode, the boot controller and boot order are set automatically.  Press the Power On/Standby button.  During the initial boot:  To modify the server configuration ROM default settings, press the F9 key in the ProLiant POST screen to enter the UEFI System Utilities screen.
