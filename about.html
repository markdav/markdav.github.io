				Living near Galway on the west coast of Ireland.				 
			</p>
			<p>
				Working in Hewlett Packard as an application developer in Technology Services Research and Development. Currently working on some java + python applications in the area of big data. People often complain about their job, but in fairness, HP has been a great employer for me, there's still enough of the HP-way left that people and innovation are still valued.

				Keen interest in athletics, in particular distance and middle distance running.  I run a bit myself and have pbs of 15:52 (5k), 33:24 (10k) and 2:37 (Marathon).  Unfortunately injuries caught up with me and now I coach at local club Craughwell AC in between making comeback attempts!

				Hugely interested in all things technology and, oh for more time. Some day I'm actually going to finish off all the projects I've started.  Or not.  Other interested include phases of binges on TV Shows (currently "the Wire") and reading books (mostly Sci-fi)

				Proud dad of 3 and husband of one.

				The "At the Borders" name comes from a famous quote by running legend Emil Zatopec, his comment was <i>"it is at the borders of pain and suffering that men are separated from the boys"</i>.  The quote always stuck with me, but in this blog the relevance is to do with borders in terms of APIs and edge cases, which is where many apps are made or broken.
