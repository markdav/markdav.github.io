Making a fresh attempt to use github some more, there's jsut so much up there to learn, share, etc.  We are moving to the github flow model in work too from a legacy subversion system, so I guess familiarity is no harm.

Using Jekyll for the blog..  It's an interesting technology, basically it's a ruby html generator which can be used to break your site into a set of static files, and manage them this way instead of as a dynamic database-backed thing.  I installed Jekyll expecting to see a CMS or bunches of files created in the install directory..  Then I realised that it doesn't actually create any files, you need to do that yourself.

Essentially you write text files of a given specification and when you run "jekyll build" or upload them to 
github, it generates the static HTML needed to run the site. After spending a while tonight coming up with an ugly site, I found a pretty good project called Jekyll Bootstrap that _does_ allow you to treat it more like a CMS.  There are also a few themes that you can install - going with this "simple" one for now, but will try to get around to customizing it.

If you're going to get started with Jekyll, check out the bootstrap [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/):
