Making a fresh attempt to use github some more, there's just so much up there to learn, share, etc on this site - it's really becoming the center of the coding universe.  We are moving to the github flow model in work too, so pull requests and origin branches are indemic.

Decided to try Jekyll for the blog..  It's an interesting technology, basically it's a ruby html generator which can be used to break your site into a set of static files, and manage them this way instead of as a dynamic database-backed thing.  I installed Jekyll expecting to see a CMS or bunches of files created in the install directory..  but was surprised to see that it doesn't actually create any files, you need to do that yourself.

Essentially you write text files of a given specification and when you run "jekyll build" or upload them to github, it will proceed to generate the static HTML needed to run the site. After spending a while tonight coming up with an in the end ugly site, I found a pretty good project called Jekyll Bootstrap that _does_ allow you to treat it more like a CMS.  There are also a few themes that you can install - going with this "simple" one for now, but will try to get around to customizing it.

If you're going to get started with Jekyll, check out the bootstrap [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).  Another interesting site to look at with respect to jekyll is prose.io, as it lets you edit your pages from the browser or phone for an easy way to do things on the fly.  The article below comes with Jekyl and is not a bad place to look for details on it.
